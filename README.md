## Pymaceuticals Study
This repository documents the analysis of a clinical study conducted by Pymaceuticals, Inc., to evaluate the efficacy of various drug regimens in treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in mice. 249 mice with SCC tumors were treated with a range of drug regimens, including Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Tumor development was monitored over a 45-day period.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this study was to compare the performance of Capomulin, Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, against other treatment regimens in terms of tumor volume reduction and overall treatment efficacy.

## Anaysis Tasks: 
1. Data Preparation: Import and merge the mouse_metadata.csv and study_results.csv datasets.
2. Summary Statistics: Generate summary statistics for each drug regimen, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean for tumor volume.
3. Data Visualization:
   * Create a bar chart to visualize the total number of timepoints for each drug regimen.
   * Generate a pie chart to illustrate the distribution of female versus male mice in the study.
   * Create a box plot to compare the distribution of tumor volume across different treatment regimens.
   * Generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.
   * Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
4. Correlation and Regression Analysis: Calculate the correlation coefficient and perform linear regression analysis to assess the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.
5. Outlier Detection: Identify and analyze potential outliers in tumor volume data for each treatment regimen.

## Key Findings (Preliminary):
1. Treatment Efficacy:
   * Capomulin and Ramicane showed promising results with lower median tumor volumes and potentially more consistent treatment outcomes compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin.
   * Infubinol exhibited potential variability in treatment response, with an outlier suggesting a significant impact on a subset of mice.
2. Study Design and Data:
   * Capomulin and Ramicane were associated with a higher number of observed timepoints, suggesting a greater focus on these regimens in the study.
3. Mouse Weight and Tumor Volume:
   * Preliminary analysis of the Capomulin regimen suggests a possible correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume, indicating that heavier mice may exhibit larger tumors. Further investigation is warranted to confirm this relationship.
